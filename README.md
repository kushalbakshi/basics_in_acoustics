# detect_mouse_clicks
Repository made for a project collaboration with lab of Dr. Michelle Hook at Texas A&M University.
The preprocessing branch has the most recent version of the MATLAB code used to detect click-like vocalizations from mice using locally-stored audio files.
The figures branch contains scripts that generate spectrograms and waveforms from locally-stored audio files.
Most of the audiofiles in this project are ~5 min continuous recordings at either 96 or 192kHz. The recordings are obtained every 7 days.
